# --- Placeholder for Authentication Logic ---

# In a real app, you would likely have middleware that runs before protected routes.
# This middleware would:
# 1. Extract a token (e.g., JWT) from the request headers (Authorization: Bearer <token>).
# 2. Verify the token using a library like PyJWT and your secret key/public key.
# 3. If valid, extract the user ID (or other relevant info) from the token payload.
# 4. Store the user ID on Flask's 'g' object (g.user_id = ...) or pass it explicitly.
# 5. If invalid, return a 401 Unauthorized error immediately.

# For services like Clerk, Firebase Auth, Auth0, you'd typically verify their token
# using their provided SDKs or by checking against their public keys.
